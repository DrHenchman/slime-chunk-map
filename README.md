# Slime Chunk Maps

Generate loot tables and map dat files for use as slime chunk maps. That is, makes
which have markers for which chunks are slime chunks.

Slime chunk maps are generated in successive rings like as follows:

    10 11 12 13 14
    25 02 03 04 15
    24 09 01 05 16
    23 08 07 06 17
    22 21 20 19 18
